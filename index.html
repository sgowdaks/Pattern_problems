  <h1>Blog for my reference!</h1>
  <h2>Floyd's Cycle Detection</h2>
  <p>
    <ol>Find the Duplicate Number: 1. Use fast and slow pointers, after fast and slow pointer collides remove the fast pointers and place the slow pointer at the begining.
      When both slow and fast pointer intersect, that will be the duplicate number.</ol>
    <ol>Detect the cycle in the linkedlist</ol>
  </p>
  <h2>Arrays</h2>
  <h3>Parent problem: Merge 2 sorted arrays without using extra space</h3>
  <p>
    <ol>Median of 2 sorted arrays of equal size</ol>
    <ol>Median of 2 sorted arrays of different size</ol>
  </p>
  <h3>Parent problem:  longest increasing subsequence</h3>
  <p>
    <ul>
        Russian dolls envelopes
    </ul>
  </p>
  <h2>Bit Manipulation</h2>
  <ul><p>To get the right most set bit: (formula) bit = bit & ~(bit - 1)</p></ul>
  <ul><p>XOR of a number by itself cancels out, this logic can be used to find Non Repeating Numbers types of problems where, with 2 or 1 numbers that is not repeating</p></ul>
  <ul><p>If you want to find the count of 1's in given bits, either using even/odd concept with recursion, or and with 1 and right shift, or bin() from python(bad move!)</p></ul>
  <h2>Binary Trees</h2>
  <p>Given 2 trees, and you want to know if both are same. Always use POST ORDER TRAVERSAL></p>
  <h3>Parent problem: Lowest Common Ancestor in a BST</h3>
<ul><p>Find distance between 2 nodes in a Binary tree</p></ul>
<h2>Binary Search Trees</h2>
 <ul><p>Inorder Traversal of a Binary search tree is always sorted</p></ul>
 <ul><p>If you want to find inorder Predecessor: one left and extreme right </p></ul>
 <ul><p>If you want to find inorder Successor: one right and extreme left</p></ul>
<h2>Strings</h2>
<p>Parent problem: Min Number of Flips (There is only 2 ways an alternate string can be one with starts with 1's and other with 0's.</p>
  <ul><p>Minimum Number of Flips to Make the Binary String Alternating </p><ul>
